# Agent Guidelines

## Package Manager

This project uses **pnpm** (not npm or yarn). Always use `pnpm` commands:

- `pnpm install` - Install dependencies
- `pnpm add <package>` - Add a dependency
- `pnpm dev` - Run development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production

## Code Style

- Prefer `const` over `let` whenever the variable is not reassigned

## Commits

- Conventional commits, lowercase, imperative: `fix: show share URL input on iOS Safari`.
- One commit per change — squash, don't stack fixups.
- Subject only. Add a body just when the _why_ isn't obvious from the diff, and keep
  it to a few wrapped lines.
- No `Co-Authored-By`, no `Generated with Claude Code`, no session links, no emoji.

## Modules

- Use ESM `import`, not CommonJS `require` — in source, scripts, and ad-hoc
  verification snippets (e.g. `node --input-type=module -e "import { x } from './frontend/src/lib/api.svelte.ts'"`).

## Product Feel

The app is a video game, not a CRUD interface: performant, reactive, low latency. The user should feel in
control and feel good using it.

- Every input answers on the next frame. Show the response first, then let the data settle behind it.
- Never block the UI on the network or the scanner: show what is there, refine in the background (paging,
  cover warming, polling). Background work must not starve what is on screen.
- The user stays in control: no layout jumps, reshuffles, scroll or focus changes they did not ask for.
  A background refresh replaces content in place, it never resets the view.
- Anything ongoing shows its state (indexing, loading) at a lively rate, not a sluggish one.
- Hold 60 fps through transitions and scrolling; measure on a phone, not just the desktop.

## UI Regression Testing

- Use the agent-driven workflow in `frontend/tests/agent/README.md`. Follow
  `frontend/tests/agent/AUDIT-PROMPT.md` for a full visual audit and
  `frontend/UX-AUDIT.md` for the repeatable Mac-app checklist.
- Prefer Codex browser/computer controls or `agent-browser` for UI testing.
  Do not introduce Playwright or Cypress test frameworks unless requested.
- When UI testing is requested, start the isolated synthetic library with
  `pnpm --dir frontend audit:serve`, then run
  `pnpm --dir frontend audit:regressions` when `agent-browser` is available.
  Use its documented browser setup or `AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`.
- Cover 1920×1080, 1440×900, 1024×768 and 390×844. Check card hover and keyboard
  focus, default play and track actions, searchable dropdowns, filters, both
  library views, Settings, Display menus, Simple/Advanced sliders and all
  component styles. Verify scrolling and background updates preserve tile
  order, scroll position and the queue.
- Save screenshots and pass/fail/blocked results in `.audit-results/`.
  Passing interaction assertions or capturing screenshots does not establish
  a visual pass: inspect the images and compare with approved references.
  Never approve changed references automatically to hide a regression.
- Use synthetic data for repeatable browser checks. Validate the actual
  repository-local Mac app separately, preserving accounts, permissions,
  preferences and playback. Report physical-touch, performance, live Spotify
  and audio-capture checks as untested unless actually exercised.
- For requested validation, also run `pnpm --dir frontend check`,
  `pnpm --dir desktop test` and `pnpm --dir desktop build:frontend` as applicable.
  Stop temporary servers, close audit-created browser sessions and reset
  viewport overrides afterward.
