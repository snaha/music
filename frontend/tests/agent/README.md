# Agent-driven Music regressions

Use Codex computer/browser controls or the installed `agent-browser` CLI. There
is no Playwright test dependency or Cypress dependency in this workflow. The CLI
may use browser-automation libraries internally; this project does not maintain
Playwright specs.

## Start the isolated fixture

```sh
pnpm --dir frontend audit:serve
```

Opens a loopback server at http://127.0.0.1:4178 after building the frontend.
Contains 240 synthetic albums, a playlist, long titles and multiple discs. The local Subsonic API is synthetic; playback uses real HTML audio elements
and a 180-second silent WAV stream with range support. Listening history uses an isolated temporary
SQLite database, deleted when the fixture server stops. No user library, tokens or audible music are used.
Reload resets the fixture's browser preferences. Keep the fixture separate from
the actual app, whose settings and playback are real.

## Repeatable agent-browser assertions

The fixture has a small contract test for the current desktop status API and
listener cleanup. Run it with `pnpm --dir frontend audit:test`; CI runs it alongside
frontend checks and the desktop/frontend test suite before packaging.

With `agent-browser` installed and its browser available:

```sh
pnpm --dir frontend audit:regressions
```

If a browser executable is already installed, set
`AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to its full path. Otherwise run
`agent-browser install` using your installed CLI's documented setup. The CLI
must support `set viewport`, `hover`, `focus`, `eval`, `snapshot` and `screenshot`.
Set `MUSIC_AGENT_BROWSER` to use another CLI executable location.

Runs at 1920×1080, 1440×900, 1024×768 and 390×844. Checks hover/focus and overlay
hit testing, separate cover browsing and collection playback, listening state,
album/playlist views, catalog result filtering and Add to queue without playback,
dropdown opening/no-match/Escape/selection/reset,
Settings modal centering, focus containment, category keys, local folder actions,
keyboard selection and nested Escape, click-only menus and keyboard dismissal, track-detail
overflow, and scroll/tile-order preservation during background updates.

Writes timestamped screenshots, results.json, and failure screenshots/snapshots
to `.audit-results/`. Exits nonzero on a failed assertion. Uses the isolated
`music-regressions` browser session and closes it afterward.

**Screenshot capture is not a visual pass.** Codex or a human must inspect them,
compare with approved references, and record visual results. Agent judgment is
useful for UX review but cannot guarantee the same decisions across runs.

## Full Codex audit

Give Codex the prompt in `AUDIT-PROMPT.md`. It includes additional exploratory
checks, all three styles, sliders, resize-open panels and the actual Mac app.
Codex can use its built-in computer controls without agent-browser installed.
The existing `pnpm --dir desktop test` remains the deterministic playback/library
regression suite. Physical phone, audible output and performance need their
separate release checks in `frontend/UX-AUDIT.md`.

Only replace approved screenshots after reviewing an intentional design change.
Never treat a new screenshot as approved solely because the runner completed.

## Validation records

Run the suite on the branch you intend to ship. See `docs/core-validation.md` for
the extracted core results and native import/search/playback evidence. Earlier
mixed-provider runs do not establish a pass for core. Screenshots remain evidence,
not approved replacement references.
